# Mondeal

## Done

- Playing properties
- Playing money
- Playing actions as money
- Sly Deal
- Pass Go
- Deal Breaker
- Players shouldn't be able to cancel rent
- Rent cards!
- Just Say No
- 2-color property wildcards (in addition to the "any color" wild card)
- Bug: when a player does "Just Say No", and it cancels the current player's last action for their turn, the next person's turn should start automatically.
- Don't allow players to pay rent with cards from their hand
- House
- Hotel
- Forced Deal
- Debt Collector
- Sly Deal said "no one has properties to steal" when they did.
- Remove ability to cancel out of a forced deal. Game gets stuck otherwise
- When 1 player pays the rent, it doesn't let anyone else pay rent, but the game cant continue because it's waiting for everyone to pay rent.
- Debt collector didn't give an opportunity to use Just Say No

## TODO

- Deal Breaker said there was no set to steal when there was.
- It's My Birthday
- Double The Rent
- If a player has more cards for a color than the set limit, start a new set for that color
- When you have 0 cards, you draw 5 cards instead of 2
- Player has to discard down to 7 cards at end of turn
- Disallow playing Just Say No as an action on your own turn, not in response to anything
